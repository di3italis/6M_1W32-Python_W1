this is the first week of python  at aa
just submitted full stack react/redux project yesterday
for the second attempt. the first time around i only got about 
half way through the project. after taking time off when mom
passed, i had forgotten a lot of fundamentals. as well as completely forgetting 
most of react and redux, which had been fresh in my mind at the time.

anyway, after a month of catching up, failing, gaining some kind of understanding
backm i finally passed, and now moving on to PYTHON!!!! WOOT!
